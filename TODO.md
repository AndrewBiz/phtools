- [x] core - runner.rb: print class instance variables in debug mode
- [x] phls: use init method to initialize variables
- [x] phls: change -r to -R
- [ ] phls: make it work with .folders (like ftls did)
- [x] phmove: create phmove tool based on ftarrange code (see ftools repo)
- [x] phmove: make target_folder as parameter not an option
- [x] phmove: -a (--arrange) parameter means to put photo, video, raw files into separate folders inside target. If -a is not set all files are moved to root of target directory (plain collection of files)
- [x] phmove: delete unused empty RAW and VIDEO folders
- [ ] phmove: make options to set video, raw folder names
- [x] phrename: add -c --clean option (based on ftclname functionality)
- [x] phrename: add -s --shift_time option (based on ftfixdate functionality)
- [x] phrename: by-default read tags for creation DateTime in this order: DateTimeOriginal, DateCreated, CreateDate, DigitalCreationDate, FileModifyDate (eqv to File::mtime). 1st non-zero value will be taken as a master photo creation timestamp. It means no longer names like '00000101-000000_ANB IMG_0183.PNG' will appear.
- [ ] phrename: make it safe and smart. Once the file was renamed to PHTOOL standard, next run of phrename should not change the DateTime info unless options -t or -s are explicitly set. If user wants to reset file name using exif tag - 1st clean it `phrename --clean`, then rename `phrename -a anb` OR run `phrename -t DateTimeOriginal`
- [x] get rid of nesty
- [x] switch to fresh MiniExiftool gem
